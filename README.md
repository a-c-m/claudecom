## Architecture

ClaudeCom acts as a bridge between terminal applications and chat platforms. It:

1. Reads output from stdin (piped from terminal apps)
2. Forwards output to configured chat platforms
3. Receives commands from chat
4. Injects commands back to the terminal app via named pipes (FIFOs)

## Current Status

ðŸš§ This project is under active development. Core piping functionality is being implemented.
